\section{Introduction and Motivation}
While older software-systems have established an industry standard for their architectural design patterns, the growing requirements for new systems make it increasingly harder to keep up. In order to adapt, scientific authors examine the different architectures and their impact on quality attributes. These scientific articles serve as an inspiration for system developers for their system designs. For new production environments like Industry 4.0 (I4.0) the adaptation of a standard architectural design patterns is ongoing. This study uses scientific articles to design a prototype software-solution for an industry 4.0 production. The research resulted in a prototype using a combination of MQTT and Kafka.
