\section{Problem, research questions and Approach}

\label{sec:problem}
A ball pen manufacturer needs to create a fully automated production line, with the specified requirements of high availability and easy interoperability, to avoid unnecessary downtime. 
The company wants the software architecture to support potential growth in production, so the ability to add more cells must be supported. 
When a fault occurs within the system architecture it needs to respond automatically to maintain high availability. To facilitate early problem fixing, the system should be monitored, either by a separate system or internally. All the data collected through monitoring needs to be sent to a separate system, to be analyzed in order to optimize the production.  \\ 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which architectural patterns would best align with the system's quality attributes?
    \item Which tech stack could contribute positively towards the required quality attributes?
    \item Which framework should manage internal communication between subsystems?\\
\end{enumerate}

The following steps were taken to answer this paper's research questions: 
\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyse the problem, and set a scope
    \item Find related works and articles
    \item Review chosen articles
    \item Analyse article solutions
    \item Use cases and Quality attribute scenarios
    \item Design solution
    \item Prototyping and testing
\end{enumerate}
